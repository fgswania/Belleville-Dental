        <p style="color: #171a1e; font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Treatment of an abscessed tooth An abscessed tooth is a pocket of pus, usually caused by some 
            kind of infection and the spread of bacteria from the root of the tooth to the tissue just below or 
            near the tooth. In general, a tooth that has become abscessed is one whose underlying pulp<span id="dots">...</span>
            <span id="more">(the tooth's soft core) has become infected or swollen. The pulp contains nerves, blood vessels and connective tissue, 
                and lies within the tooth. It extends from the crown of the tooth, to the tip of the root, in the bone of the jaws.
                 An abscessed tooth can be an extremely painful condition. In some cases, antibiotics are administered in an attempt to 
                 kill an infection. If antibiotics are ineffective and an abscess is shown to be damaging the pulp or lower bony
                  structures, a root canal procedure may be needed to remove the dead pulp and restore the tooth to a healthy state. </span></p>

             <p style="color:#171a1e; font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">An estimated sixty-five percent 
                of Americans have bad breath. Over forty-million Americans have "chronic halitosis," which is persistent
                 bad breath. Ninety percent of all halitosis is of oral, not systemic, origin. Americans spend more than $1
                  billion a year on over the counter halitosis products,<span id="dot">...</span>
                  <span id="content">Bad breath is caused by a variety of factors. In most cases, it is caused by food remaining in the mouth 
                    - on the teeth, tongue, gums, and other structures, collecting bacteria. Dead and dying bacterial cells
                     release a sulfur compound that gives your breath an unpleasant odor. Certain foods, such as garlic and onions, 
                     contribute to breath odor. Once the food is absorbed into the bloodstream, it is transferred to the lungs, 
                     here it is exhaled. Brushing, flossing and mouthwash only mask the odor. Dieters sometimes develop unpleasant 
                     breath from fasting.

                <h2 style="color: black;">Canker/Cold Sores</h2>
                <p style="color: #171a1e; font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">People sometimes confuse canker 
                    sores and cold sores, but they are completely unrelated. Both can be painful, but knowing the differences can help
                     you keep them in check. A canker sore is typically one that occurs on the delicate tissues inside your mouth. It
                      is usually light-colored at its base and<span id="dotsss">...</span>
                     <span id="add"> can have a red exterior border. A cold sore or fever blister, on the other hand, 
                        usually occurs on the outside of the mouth, usually on or near the nose or lips. A cold sore
                         is contagious because it is caused by the herpes simplex virus, and it is usually painful 
                         and filled with fluid. <br><br>
                         In most cases, patience is the best medicine for treating canker sores. A healthy diet and good oral
                          hygiene are usually the best remedy, but some special rinses and anesthetics can help. Cold sores can be
                           treated effectively with some over-the-counter topical creams; sometimes, an antiviral medication will be 
                           prescribed by your doctor.

                   <h2 style="color: black;">Cavities and Tooth Decay</h2>
                   <p style="color: #171a1e; font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">
                    What Is Tooth Decay? Tooth decay is caused by a variety of things; in medical terms, cavities are 
                    called caries, which are caused by long-term destructive forces acting on tooth structures such as enamel
                     and the tooth's inner dentin material. These destructive forces include frequent exposure to
                     <span id="move">...</span>
                     <span id="addto">  foods rich in sugar and carbohydrates. Soda, candy, ice cream—even milk—are
                         common culprits.  Left inside your mouth from non-brushing and flossing, these materials
                          break down quickly, allowing bacteria to do their dirty work in the form of a harmful, 
                          colorless sticky substance called plaque.
                        <br><br>
                        The plaque works in concert with leftover food particles in your mouth to form harmful 
                        acids that destroy enamel and other tooth structures. <br><br>
                        If cavities aren't treated early enough, they can lead to more serious problems 
                        requiring treatments such as root canal therapy.

                     <p style="color: #171a1e; font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Even though many oral diseases are preventable,

                         are prevalent among all age groups:</p>
                        <ul style="color: #171a1e;">
                        <li>25% of children between ages 2 and 5 experience tooth decay.</li>
                        <li>50% of children between ages 12 and 15 experience tooth decay.</li>
                       <li>Nearly 25% of adults between ages 20 and 64 report having untreated cavities.</li>
                       <li>25% of adults age 65 and older have no natural teeth left.</li></ul>
                        <p style="color: #171a1e; font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">Dental hygiene patient education can equip people of any age to make changes to
                         prevent disease. Avoiding oral disease increases your patients’ health, comfort
                          and happiness, thereby improving their quality of life.</p><br><br>

                          <center><h1 style="color: #05696b; font-weight: bolder;">Increased Patient Trust</h1></center>
                          <p style="color: #171a1e; font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">
                            Patient trust is a valuable asset in all medical professions, but it is especially vital within dentistry.
                             The Journal of Dental Education aptly notes that a great deal of success in oral health care relies on the 
                             patient. Prevalent oral conditions like periodontal disease and dental caries require patient-driven treatments. 
                             If your patient doesn’t complete regular brushing, flossing and checkups, and follow a healthy diet and exercise 
                             routine, they will be at a disadvantage when fighting oral diseases. <br><br>
                             Taking time to thoroughly educate your patients about preventive hygiene and ways to improve their 
                              health communicates your care to a patient. When a patient knows you have their best interests at heart,
                               they may be more motivated to listen to, implement and trust your advice.

                            When you educate your dental patients, several barriers may obstruct your effectiveness.
                             Many patients experience fear and anxiety while at the dentist’s office. Patients also don’t 
                             want to receive a lecture or feel shamed for their oral health. These barriers can make patients 
                             feel guarded and less receptive to crucial information.
                          </p>

                            According to the Journal of Dental Education, person-centered care focuses on a partnership with the 
                            patient and their family to produce health outcomes. Some of the characteristics of person-centered
                             care include:

                            <li>
